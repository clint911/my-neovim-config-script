#my neovim config
I recently switched to a full-fledged Neovim personalized set up.
Copy the following command in your home directory after installing neovim and cloning this repo
`cp -r nvim ~/.config/nvim/`
--source, target
Ensure you cd into my-neovim-config-script before running the above command
Source the config before opening Neovim, It should auto install.
I use the following languages/libraries/frameworks so it provides first-hand support for them:
React,Typescript, Solidity, Java, Cpp, Go & Python. Feel free to add any as needed
The current theme used is RosePine.
The terminal used it Kitty
The Font is VictorMono Nerd Font Propo ExtraLight Italic 17.7
Q&A:
The above config uses packer, I have heard about lazy but I don't care, I'm not switching.
Any issues setting up you can reach out to me via email  at clingyking007@gmail.com or @KingClingy on twitter
#Finally made the Grand Switch to Lazy
#fine-tuned changes to my nvim config to improve both my workflow and generally to make it look way cool
