#my neovim config
I recently switched to a full-fledged Neovim personalized set up.
Copy the following command in your home directory after installing neovim and cloning this repo
`cp -r nvim ~/.config/nvim/`
Ensure you cd into my-neovim-config-script before running the above command
Source the config before opening Neovim, It should auto install.
Incase it doesn't, simply run `:packerSync` command to give it a nudge
I use the following languages/libraries/frameworks so it provides first-hand support for them:
React,Typescript, Solidity, Java, Cpp, Svelte. Feel free to add any as needed
The current theme used is RosePine.
The terminal used it Iterm, the background image can be sourced from thePrimagen's repo.
The Font is FiraCode NF light 16
Q&A:
The above config uses packer, I have heard about lazy but I don't care, I'm not switching.
Any issues setting up you can reach out to me via email  at clingyking007@gmail.com or @KingClingy on twitter
